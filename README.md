This repository shows various computer programs I have written as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon Univesity. </br>

I have divided it into two main folders:
* C++ Projects
* Python Projects

Each folder contains sub-folders labeled with the course names. In the folder for each course, there is a folder for each assignment.</br>
Each assignment folder contains the source code, and may contain a pdf describing the assignment, if one was given by the professor.</br>
Most assignments in python were submitted in a jupyter notebook format and in that case the description of the task is written in the notebook.
